# microwave

this plugin bakes out all layers of MVC, fixtures and tests for all tables in a configured database
it's quite powerful, and overwrites everything so be very careful. wonderful for baking an app
from a relatively large, pre-existing database.

## installation

drop the contents into your application's plugin folder. for example, `my_app/plugins/microwave`
run `cake microwave`
